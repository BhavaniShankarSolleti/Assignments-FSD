        "\n",
        "1. **challenge - Content not visible to crawlers**\n",
        "\n",
        "  Like search engine bots like google may not see dyanmically loaded content if web pages are heavily relies on javascript.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **solution - preendering or static generation**\n",
        "   Render content on the server before loading it to the browser.Framworks like next.js(react or nuxt.js(vue) support this.\n",

        "2. **Challenge - Poor Indexing of pages.**\n",
        "\n",
        " Since SPA’s often have only one html file(index.html) multiple pages dont exist as seperate routes unless specifically handled.\n",

        " SPA’s often use client-side routing (#/about) which may not be SEO-friendly.\n",

        "  Rendering javascript before displaying content increases time to first byte(TTFB) and first contentful paint(FCP).\n",

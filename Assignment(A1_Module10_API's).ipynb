        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "\n",
        "**API**\n",
        "* API stands for application programming interface.\n",
        "* It is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.\n",
        "* We can think it like a messenger that takes a request from one program, delivers it to another, and brings back the response.\n",
        "Ex: When we a food delivery app.It doesn't cook the food or store restauarant data itself. It uses API's to:\n",
        "   * Fetch restuarent details\n",
        "   * Place our order.\n",
        "   * Track delivery.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why important**\n",
        "* comunication between systems: **bold text** API's let applications talk each other(Ex: frontend <-> backend app,app<->database).\n",
        "* Reusability: **bold text** Developers dont have to build everything from scratch. They can use existing api's(like google maps api for location, weather api for weather data).\n",
        "* Integration: API's connect services. EX: payment gatway api's(Razorpay,stripe,paypal). Human verification api's Ex: cloudflare etc.\n",
        "* Scalability: Businesses can expose certain parts of thier services via api's, enabling growth(Ex: Twitter, youtube api's for developers).\n",
        "* Security: Apis act as controlled enty point.Only what is exposed through the api can be accessed, prottecting internal systems.\n",
        "* Automation: Apis's enable different systesm work together without manaual effort(Ex: CRM system automatically sending emails using gmail api).\n",
        "* An APis is a bridge that connects different applciations and services, making software more powerful, reusable, secure and scalable."

        "2.Explain the core principles of REST APi's ?\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "1. Client-server architecture\n",
        "   * The client( Ex: react frontend) and the server (Ex: Node.js/express backend) are separate.\n",
        "   * Client requests -> server responds -> clear seperation of responsibilites.\n",
        "   * This makes apps more scalable and flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Statelessness\n",
        "   * Each request from client to server must contain all necessary information.\n",
        "   * Server doesn't store client context between requests.\n",
        "   * Ex: Client sends login credentials -> Server verifies -> server gives a token.\n",
        "   * In future request's, the client must send that token again.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Uniorm interface\n",
        "   * A consistent of interacting with resources using standard rules.\n",
        "   * Resources identified by url's\n",
        "   * Ex: /users/101 refers to user with id 101.\n",
        "   * Standard HTTP methods\n",
        "      * Get -> Retrive\n",
        "      * POST -> Create\n",
        "      * PUT/PATCH -> Update\n",
        "      * DELETE -> Remove\n",
        "   * Consistent strucure: JSON is common for request/response format.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Resource based\n",
        "   * Everthing in REST is treated as resource(users, order, products,payments).\n",
        "   * Ex: /product/45 -> product with id 45\n",
        "5. Layered system\n",
        "   * A REST API may have multiple layers (load balancers, authentication, servers, caching).\n",
        "   * Client does not need to know whether it's directly talking to the backend or through intermediaries.\n",
        "6. Cacheability\n",
        "   * Responses should indicate whether they can be cached( to improve performance).\n",
        "   * Ex: A list of products might be cached, but user login details should not.\n",
        "7. Code on demand\n",
        "   * server can provide executable code to the client to extend functionality.\n",
        "   * Not commonly used, but part of the REST principles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Summary: RESTful API's are resource based, stateless, cacheable, uses standard http methods and ensure uniform layered architecture.\n"

        "   * Idempotent: Multiple calls with the same data won’t change the result after the first update.\n",
        "\n",
